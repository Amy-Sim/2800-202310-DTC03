## 7. Use of AI 
Our app incorporates AI through the implementation of a chatbot powered by OpenAI and a dataset stored in MongoDB. We utilized Python with Flask and LamaIndex to enable the AI to access our MongoDB dataset. As a result, our AI chatbot offers users the ability to search for recipes and receive personalized suggestions based on their pantry items. By leveraging the capabilities of AI and utilizing a comprehensive recipe dataset, the chatbot can provide accurate recipe recommendations and address user inquiries effectively. To enhance the user experience, we have incorporated four distinct personas for the chatbot, allowing users to select the one that aligns with their preferences. Additionally, users can enjoy lighthearted humor as the chatbot entertains them with amusing jokes.

## 9. Features for Future
As part of our future plans for PantryMaster, we are considering exciting features to enhance the user experience.
1. Voice recognition technology 
    This would allow users to interact with the app using their voice, enabling a hands-free and intuitive cooking experience. Users can set their preferred voice persona, and our AI-powered assistant will provide cooking instructions and guidance using that voice, adding a personalized touch to the cooking process. This innovative feature aims to make cooking more convenient, engaging, and accessible for users, further elevating their culinary journey with PantryMaster.
2. Nutritional Information and Meal Planning 
    Integrate a comprehensive nutritional information database into PantryMaster, allowing users to track their daily intake of calories, macronutrients, and other dietary factors. Additionally, provide meal planning functionalities that help users create balanced meal plans based on their nutritional goals.
3. Smart Shopping List 
    Develop a smart shopping list feature that syncs with users' pantry inventory and recipe selections. The app can automatically generate a shopping list based on missing ingredients, quantities needed, and preferred stores. This would streamline the grocery shopping process and ensure users have everything they need for their chosen recipes.
4. Social Sharing and Community 
    Build a social sharing platform within PantryMaster, enabling users to share their favorite recipes, cooking tips, and food experiences with a community of like-minded home cooks. This feature would foster engagement, inspiration, and collaboration among users.
