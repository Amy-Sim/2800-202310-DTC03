    - Langchain (0.0.154) - Framework for developing applications powered by language models.
    - GPT (3.0 Ada) - An advanced language model developed by OpenAI.
    - Flask (2.0.1) - Lightweight and versatile web framework for Python.
    - PyMongo (4.3.3) - Python driver for MongoDB.

2. 3rd party APIs and frameworks 
    OpenAI API key

3. Required API key
    Your OpenAI API key should be stored in your .env file.

4. Installation process for the dependencies
    1. Open Visual Studio Code: Launch the Visual Studio Code application on your Windows computer.
    2. Open your project folder: Use the File menu or the Open Folder button in Visual Studio Code to navigate and open the folder where your project is located.
    3. Open the integrated terminal: In Visual Studio Code, go to the View menu and select "Terminal" or use the shortcut Ctrl+ backtick (`) to open the integrated terminal at the bottom of the window.
    4. Check if Node.js and npm are installed: In the terminal, type the following commands and press Enter after each one: node --version and npm --version
    5. Install dependencies using npm: In the terminal, navigate to your project folder using the cd command.
    6. Install each dependency: Once you are in the project folder, use the following command to install each dependency listed in number 12 of Section #2 one by one. Replace <dependency> with the actual name of the dependency you want to install (i.e. npm install <dependency>)
    7. Repeat step 6 for all dependencies: Run the npm install command for each dependency you listed in your project.
    8. Verify the installation: After the installation of each dependency is complete, you can check the package.json file in your project folder to ensure that the dependencies are listed there.  
 
5. Configuration instruction
    - For running our PantryMaster Node.js application, the developer needs to install the following:
        1. Node.js: Install the latest version of Node.js from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/). Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions. 
        2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can choose any IDE. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code.
        3. Database: Make sure to have MongoDB installed and running. You can visit the official MongoDB website (https://www.mongodb.com/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
        4. Add an.env file: In your project directory, create an .env file. This file will contain environment variables used by our Node.js application. This file contains necessary configuration variables, such as database connection strings, API keys, or any other sensitive information required by our application.
        5. To set up and install the project dependencies listed in the package.json file, follow these steps:
            - Navigate to your project directory using the command line or terminal.
            - Install project dependencies using npm by typing: npm install
            - This command will read the package.json file and install all the listed dependencies.
        6. Once the dependencies are installed and the .env file is added, you can proceed with developing and running our Node.js application. You can use the scripts defined in the package.json file, such as "start" for starting the server using node ./controller/server.js
        7. Once the Node server is running, open your browser and navigate to localhost:3000. This will allow you to access and interact with our application through the local development server.
    
    - Our Node.js application includes a chatbot implemented in Flask, which needs to be running on a separate server. To run the application with the chatbot server hosted remotely, you can simply access "localhost:3000" after you run the Node server. However, if you prefer to run the chatbot server locally, please follow these steps. To run our PantryMaster Flask chatbot application server, the developer needs to install the following:
        1. Language: Python - Install the latest version of Python programming language from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/). Make sure to choose the appropriate version for your operating system.
        2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can choose an IDE based on your preference. Some popular options for Python development include PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.
        3. Python Libraries: To install the Python dependencies, you need to navigate to the /python_chatbot directory where the requirements.txt file is located. Open your command line and change the current working directory to /python_chatbot before running the 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
        4. Run the flask server: py .\python_chatbot\app.py (Windows) or python python_chatbot/app.py (Mac)
        5. Now you can go back to localhost:3000 in your web browser to access the PantryMaster Node.js application with the chatbot server running locally.

## 7. Use of AI 
1. **Use AI to help create our app**: 
    We leveraged AI specifically Chat GPT to generate ideas and suggestions during the brainstorming phase of app development. By inputting prompts and receiving generated text, we were able to explore various possibilities and gather inspiration for app features, user interactions, and content generation.
2. **Use AI to create data sets and clean data sets**:
    While we didn't use AI to directly create or clean data sets, we utilized AI techniques and algorithms to process and analyze the existing recipe dataset. This helped us extract relevant information and optimize the data for efficient retrieval by the chatbot. By applying AI algorithms, we were able to enhance the quality and usefulness of the data set, ensuring that the chatbot can provide valuable insights and recommendations to the users.
3. **Our app use AI**:
    Our app incorporates AI functionalities. The AI chatbot utilizes Python with Flask and LlamaIndex to interact with users and provide recipe recommendations based on their pantry items. The chatbot leverages AI algorithms to understand user queries, process the data, and generate appropriate responses. By utilizing AI, we aim to enhance the user experience and provide valuable assistance in finding recipes and addressing cooking-related inquiries. Additionally, the chatbot incorporates four distinct personas, which allows users to select the persona that aligns with their preferences. Each persona represents a unique character with specific traits, communication styles, and responses.
4. **Limitations and further works**:
    To overcome the challenge of having four different personas and generating the right responses, we implemented an iterative approach. We repeatedly modified the prompts and tested them to ensure that the chatbot produced the appropriate answers. During the testing phase, we tested the chatbot's responses and compared them against the desired outcomes for each persona. If the generated responses deviated from the expected behavior, we made adjustments to the prompts and retested the chatbot.

## 9. Features for Future
As part of our future plans for PantryMaster, we are considering exciting features to enhance the user experience.
1. **Voice recognition technology**: 
    This would allow users to interact with the app using their voice, enabling a hands-free and intuitive cooking experience. Users can set their preferred voice persona, and our AI-powered assistant will provide cooking instructions and guidance using that voice, adding a personalized touch to the cooking process. This innovative feature aims to make cooking more convenient, engaging, and accessible for users, further elevating their culinary journey with PantryMaster.
2. **Nutritional Information and Meal Planning**: 
    Integrate a comprehensive nutritional information database into PantryMaster, allowing users to track their daily intake of calories, macronutrients, and other dietary factors. Additionally, provide meal planning functionalities that help users create balanced meal plans based on their nutritional goals.
3. **Smart Shopping List**: 
    Develop a smart shopping list feature that syncs with users' pantry inventory and recipe selections. The app can automatically generate a shopping list based on missing ingredients, quantities needed, and preferred stores. This would streamline the grocery shopping process and ensure users have everything they need for their chosen recipes.
4. **Social Sharing and Community**:
    Build a social sharing platform within PantryMaster, enabling users to share their favorite recipes, cooking tips, and food experiences with a community of like-minded home cooks. This feature would foster engagement, inspiration, and collaboration among users.
